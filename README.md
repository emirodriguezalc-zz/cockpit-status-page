I have spent most of the 24hs reading about VM and struggling to get the localhost running. Since the only computer i have is the one i use for work, i assume that there is some kind of setting thats preventing me from doing it. Sadly, i wasn't able to make it, so i decided to focus on the front end, and spend the little spare time i had to make a simple UI, getting the data from a local JSON.

If i had more time, i would have implemented sass instead of css, coded some unit tests, and maybe got deeper understanding of the possible responses from the backend in order to add some dynamic classes to highlite when something is not working properly.

I have used your website as a style reference, because i loved it. I imported the font, favicon, background image and stole the logo. I hope you like it.
